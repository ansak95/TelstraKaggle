# TelstraKaggle

This is code for the Kaggle Telstra competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/telstra-recruiting-network.
The objective of the problem is to accurately determine the severity of Telstra's network failure (whether a disruption is a momentary problem or a total interruption of connectivity) at a given time and location, based on available log data.

In this project, I investigated an approach using Light GBM and VAE (Pytorch) model for features extraction.
